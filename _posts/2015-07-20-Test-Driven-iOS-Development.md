## System test

Automated with iOS apps - **UI Automation**

### Penetration Test
Look for security problems by feeding the application with malformed input.

#### Usability test
Users interacting with the application,taking note of anything that the users got wrong.

#### Unit Test
Unit tests are small pieces of code that test the behavior of other code. They set up the preconditions,run the code under test, and make assertions about the final state.

#### Repeatable tests
Warn you about regression bugs. Provide a safety net where you want to edit the source without any change in behavior.

#### Code coverage
Measuring code coverage partially addresses the problems with test counting by mesuring the account of application code that is being executed when the tests are run. They may have value, but they still aren't the most value of your time.Eg, switch statements and or cases.

#### Red,Green,Refactor
It's all very well saying that you should write the best before you write the code,but how do you write that test?
It I had to use code that should solved this problem, how would i want to use it?
Red -> Something wrong -> Write code to make it work -> Green -> Eliminate Redundancy (Refactor,don't hurry to do that).

Red -> Green -> Refactor -> Red(Iterator)
vs 
A dozen features that have all been started but are all incomplete and unusable.

#### Refactor

Turn bad smelled codes into codes without smell.

#### YAGNI
Ya ain't gonna need it.

#### Unit Test Requirement
Identify what the application needs to do.

#### Unit Test Case Design
Design aimming at interfaces.
Write basic test cases(interfaces),modify it to meet all demands(implements),move test code to real code, refactoring, test the combined one.
Fake objects instead of more complicated objects.

#### Making the tests more readable
Macro magics

#### Frameworks
STTest\GHUnit\OCMock

#### CI
Hudson,Jenkins,Xcode Server


An email <example@example.com> link.

Simple inline link <http://chenluois.com>, another inline link [Smaller](http://25.io/smalle one more inline link with title [Resize](http://resizesafari.com "a Safari extension").

A [reference style][id] link. Input id, then anywhere in the doc, define the link with corresponding id:

[id]: http://25.io/mou/ "Markdown editor on Mac OS X"

Titles ( or called tool tips ) in the links are optional.

#### Images

An inline image ![Smaller icon](http://25.io/smaller/favicon.ico "Title here"), title is optional.

A ![Resize icon][2] reference style image.

[2]: http://resizesafari.com/favicon.ico "Title"

#### Inline code and Block code

Inline code are surround by `backtick` key. To create a block code:

	Indent each line by at least 1 tab, or 4 spaces.
    var Mou = exactlyTheAppIwant; 

####  Ordered Lists

Ordered lists are created using "1." + Space:

1. Ordered list item
2. Ordered list item
3. Ordered list item

#### Unordered Lists

Unordered list are created using "*" + Space:

* Unordered list item
* Unordered list item
* Unordered list item 

Or using "-" + Space:

- Unordered list item
- Unordered list item
- Unordered list item

#### Hard Linebreak

End a line with two or more spaces will create a hard linebreak, called `<br />` in HTML. ( Control + Return )  
Above line ended with 2 spaces.

#### Horizontal Rules

Three or more asterisks or dashes:

***

---

- - - -

#### Headers

Setext-style:

This is H1
==========

This is H2
----------

atx-style:

# This is H1
## This is H2
### This is H3
#### This is H4
##### This is H5
###### This is H6


### Extra Syntax

#### Footnotes

Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things: a marker in the text that will become a superscript number; a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes at the end of the document. A footnote looks like this:

That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.


#### Strikethrough

Wrap with 2 tilde characters:

~~Strikethrough~~


#### Fenced Code Blocks

Start with a line containing 3 or more backticks, and ends with the first line with the same number of backticks:

```
Fenced code blocks are like Stardard Markdown’s regular code
blocks, except that they’re not indented and instead rely on
a start and end fence lines to delimit the code block.
```

#### Tables

A simple table looks like this:

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell

If you wish, you can add a leading and tailing pipe to each line of the table:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |

Specify alignment for each column by adding colons to separator lines:

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
:----------- | :-----------: | -----------:
Left         | Center        | Right
Left         | Center        | Right
